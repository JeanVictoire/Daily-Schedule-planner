Daily-Schedule-planner

This is a regular business hour day planner to save tasks to each hour. The planner's background color will change grey to represent past time, red to represent current time, and green to represent future time. The planner will remain grey until 12:00 AM, and will then turn green starting the new day. You can start to record your day at 9:00 AM in which the current hour will turn red to remind what tasks are due. If you close out of the day planner and reopen it, you wont lose any information.
The application was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. The application uses jQuery, and Moment JS to track time as well.
